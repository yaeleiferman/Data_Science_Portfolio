And That was democratizing online payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, Startups and SMEs. Over the last 9 years, Razorpay has evolved from a single-product company to a multi-product company, from an online payment gateway to India’s only full-stack financial solutions company, offering payments and banking solutions to businesses.  Razorpay today is transforming age-old complexities and changing every known paradigm of money movement for disruptive businesses.\r\n\r\nOver the last couple of years, Razorpay’s growth has evolved to be an index of India’s digital economy. From a kirana shop in Kashmir collecting payments on our POS device to a textile exporter in Kanyakumari accepting dollars through our International Payments product, Razorpay has revolutionised how businesses have traditionally transacted and interacted with money. \r\n\r\nRazorpay became the first and only Indian fintech to build a full-stack international Payment Gateway ‘Curlec by Razorpay’ and evolved into a comprehensive provider of payment solutions, leveraging the synergy between cutting-edge technological capabilities and a profound understanding of the local payment ecosystem. The introduction of the new Curlec Payment Gateway aims to cater to a wide spectrum of businesses, expanding its reach to over 5,000 establishments. \r\n\r\nBe it for international expansion or solving for Indian businesses, for Razorpay, the customer has always been at the core of all disruption, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions. This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay’s several industry-first innovations into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch a completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automate payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include: - First to launch India’s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ - Razorpay became India’s first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI - Razorpay also became India’s largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India’s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Razorpay’s valuation has jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley’s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company’s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. \r\n\r\nRazorpay has also made acquisitions with like-minded companies over the last 9 years. In total, till date, Razorpay has made eight acquisitions, Billme in 2023 - A Digital invoice and customer Engagement, Ezetap in 2022 - India’s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India’s leading loyalty and reward management platform, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A recurring payments platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions, Opfin (Now RazorpayX Payroll) in 2019 -  The payroll management solution and Thirdwatch in 2019, the first acquisition - The AI-powered fraud detection platform.\r\n\r\nAll these efforts are being done in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for small and big businesses. Today, Razorpay powers online payments for 76 Of 100 startup unicorns and millions of businesses in India. The core premise of what Razorpay was founded in 2014 and what it is today hasn’t changed. It is to make money movement simpler and easier, whether it is for businesses to receive money, send money, or manage money. \r\n\r\n","one_liner":"India's only full-stack financial solutions company for businesses.","team_size":2700,"industry":"Fintech","subindustry":"Fintech -> Payments","launched_at":1416309883,"tags":["Banking as a Service","Fintech","Payments","India"],"tags_highlighted":[],"top_company":true,"isHiring":true,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"Winter 2015","status":"Active","industries":["Fintech","Payments"],"regions":["India","South Asia","Remote","Partly Remote"],"stage":"Early","app_video_public":false,"demo_day_video_public":false,"app_answers":null,"question_answers":true,"objectID":"827","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"Razorpay","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"website":{"value":"https://razorpay.com","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"all_locations":{"value":"Bengaluru, KA, India","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"The journey of building Razorpay started in 2014, when Harshil Mathur (CEO & Co-Founder) and Shashank Kumar (MD & Co-Founder) witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India then and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve.

IPFS is a protocol for storing, addressing, and transferring data, designed to replace HTTP in many contexts. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify and link to information. IPFS is one of the leading protocols of Web3, crypto, and the decentralized web movements. IPFS serves millions of end users and tens of thousands of developers.

Imagine being able to write code in 1 minute, but needing to wait 30 minutes to compile, deploy, and test it.\r\n\r\nExisting solutions either require painful migrations to new tools (e.g. Bazel) or rely on just using bigger servers to run your builds. Instead, we do native, first-class integrations into compilers and build systems.\r\n\r\nWith Attune, you don't need to integrate a new tool. Just make a one-line change from `cargo build` to `hurry cargo build` for 20x faster builds.\r\n\r\nEliza (ex-Google) and Xin worked together for 3 years at FOSSA, where Eliza was Head of Engineering and Xin was Head of Product. Eliza brings a decade of programming languages and build systems expertise, while Xin brings a decade of experience building developer tools products, most recently as VP of Product at Teleport (S15).

Claim Health closes the loop between documentation and billing outcomes—using AI to detect issues, automate workflows, and recover thousands in missed revenue each week.\r\n\r\nKevin and JJ bring nearly a decade of experience building and scaling healthtech companies. At Dandy, JJ was a founding engineer and Kevin was the first GTM hire; together they helped grow the business from 0 to $150M+ ARR. At Perry (now Jolly), JJ led engineering and Kevin was Head of Sales, driving the company through a $16.5M Series A led by Tesla’s former CFO.\r\n\r\nIn under three weeks since incorporation, we've launched with three agencies and are in early discussions with large U.S. health systems.\r\n\r\nPost-acute care is a $400B market with over $20B in annual revenue leakage due to broken billing workflows. Claim Health is fixing that—starting with denials, and expanding into the full revenue cycle stack.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"The first AI revenue platform for post-acute healthcare","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Artificial Intelligence","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Health Tech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Healthcare","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":30428,"name":"Capacitive","slug":"capacitive","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/e5f362b725240ccdfc1c0cc42ebc5700507b2ddb.png","website":"https://capacitive.ai/","all_locations":"San Francisco, CA, USA","long_description":"Enterprise AI without your internal data is like a computer without internet.

A complete computing platform with:\r\n\r\n- all services for developers to fast-track deploying agents without reinventing the wheel — like framework-agnostic serverless deployments, an AI gateway for model routing and fallback, and custom MCP server hosting.\r\n- a flexible low-level API for builders to ship really performant agentic AI using our backbone infrastructure — using services like sandboxed VMs usable by agents, a programmable global gateway, and a 20ms-latency serverless compute engine.\r\n- and a seamless developper experience that integrates with their CI/CD, and APIs that can even be consumed by agents themselves!","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"AWS for AI Agents","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"AIOps","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Infrastructure","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":30365,"name":"Mentra","slug":"mentra","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/7244027171670b7caf312b35e16b9e5cfdd49164.png","website":"https://mentra.glass","all_locations":"San Francisco, CA, USA","long_description":"Mentra is building the open source operating system for smart glasses.

By enabling them to handle unlimited calls, day or night, Riviera unlocks additional revenue and eases labor challenges.\r\n","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"AI Employees for Hotels","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"SaaS","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"B2B","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Travel","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Analytics","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"AI","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":30281,"name":"Waypoint Transit","slug":"waypoint-transit","former_names":[],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/01d8fc8778559bd4b0a49a7f77d4d7cd0c4c3f19.png","website":"https://waypointtransit.com","all_locations":"","long_description":"Waypoint Transit is an AI city planner that generates civil infrastructure studies.

We wrap all of this under a beautiful, simple package for both businesses and carriers - allowing anyone to reap the benefits of rideshare freight shipping with the click of a button.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Ridesharing freight with ML to cut pallet shipping costs by 50%","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Machine Learning","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Marketplace","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"B2B","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Ridesharing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Logistics","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":29841,"name":"Elayne","slug":"elayne","former_names":["Elayne AI"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/a98fa9035236422ae40e39daab0354f2090e797e.png","website":"https://www.elayne.com/","all_locations":"New York, NY, USA","long_description":"Elayne is redefining estate management with AI-powered solutions that simplify planning, execution, and net worth optimization.

Say goodbye to the hassle of searching for the best cash exchange rates or ATMs on your next trip. With Moreta, paying local merchants is easy, and the best part? Transparent fees.\r\n\r\nWe came up with Moreta while on our own backpacking adventures. Watching locals pay with a simple scan while we fumbled with cards and cash. So, we created a solution.

Our technology has been battle-tested in Ukraine, where consumer drones converted into precise guided missiles have become a daily reality.

Prior to that, Dom led 20+ ML engineers at Adobe to build their internal ad optimization platform, which allocates $1B in annual spend. Ben built the microservices stack powering the new Microsoft Edge, scaling from 0 to hundreds of millions of DAUs.\r\n\r\nWe started coding Snowpilot in mid-August '24, and we already have a live app that can run sub-second queries on millions of rows, entirely in the user's browser.\r\n\r\nThe data warehouse market is $10B/yr, growing 23% YOY. We will disrupt incumbents and significantly expand this market by enabling non-engineers to use big data on a daily basis.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"The connected spreadsheet that destroys data silos","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"B2B","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Big Data","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Data Engineering","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"AI","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Databases","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":29685,"name":"Spongecake","slug":"spongecake","former_names":["shippd.ai"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/fb0c493c042340cfca56899d9d12bdfe0a3553b6.png","website":"https://github.com/aditya-nadkarni/spongecake","all_locations":"San Francisco, CA, USA","long_description":"Spongecake helps developers build computer use agents\r\n\r\nWith spongecake, developers can build computer use agents for their own applications, automate workflows in desktop applications with poor APIs, and automate workflows in on prem environments","one_liner":"Helping developers build computer use agents","team_size":2,"industry":"B2B","subindustry":"B2B -> Supply Chain and Logistics","launched_at":1719338941,"tags":["Generative AI","B2B","AI"],"tags_highlighted":[],"top_company":false,"isHiring":false,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"Summer 2024","status":"Active","industries":["B2B"],"regions":["United States of America","America / Canada"],"stage":"Early","app_video_public":false,"demo_day_video_public":false,"app_answers":null,"question_answers":false,"objectID":"29685","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"Spongecake","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"former_names":[{"value":"shippd.ai","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"website":{"value":"https://github.com/aditya-nadkarni/spongecake","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"all_locations":{"value":"San Francisco, CA, USA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"Spongecake helps developers build computer use agents\r\n\r\nWith spongecake, developers can build computer use agents for their own applications, automate workflows in desktop applications with poor APIs, and automate workflows in on prem environments","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"Helping developers build computer use agents","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"tags":[{"value":"Generative AI","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"B2B","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"AI","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"id":29684,"name":"Parahelp","slug":"parahelp","former_names":["Sam"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/4a523691020b3333cc7ac91fb850235d2d4a0441.png","website":"https://parahelp.com/","all_locations":"San Francisco, CA, USA","long_description":"Parahelp is the AI support agent for software companies.\r\n\r\nLike a teammate, it resolves support tickets end-to-end by using a company's existing knowledge base, SOPs, and tools (like Slack, Stripe, Retool, and Linear).","one_liner":"The AI support agent for software companies","team_size":5,"industry":"B2B","subindustry":"B2B -> Operations","launched_at":1720219864,"tags":[],"tags_highlighted":[],"top_company":false,"isHiring":true,"nonprofit":false,"batch":"Summer 2024","status":"Active","industries":["B2B","Operations"],"regions":["United States of America","America / Canada"],"stage":"Early","app_video_public":false,"demo_day_video_public":false,"app_answers":null,"question_answers":false,"objectID":"29684","_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"Parahelp","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"former_names":[{"value":"Sam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"website":{"value":"https://parahelp.com/","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"all_locations":{"value":"San Francisco, CA, USA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"long_description":{"value":"Parahelp is the AI support agent for software companies.\r\n\r\nLike a teammate, it resolves support tickets end-to-end by using a company's existing knowledge base, SOPs, and tools (like Slack, Stripe, Retool, and Linear).","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"one_liner":{"value":"The AI support agent for software companies","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}}},{"id":29683,"name":"CodeViz","slug":"codeviz","former_names":["Edison Labs"],"small_logo_thumb_url":"https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/small_logos/3b3886b4eeec86b01eb6eb8ba6e07dd24f7af701.png","website":"https://www.codeviz.ai/","all_locations":"San Francisco, CA, USA","long_description":"CodeViz creates interactive codebase maps to help engineers quickly understand and navigate code. \r\n \r\nAdopted by engineers at Amazon, Microsoft, and Roblox, CodeViz was founded by two ex-Tesla engineers to tackle the 75% of development time lost to reading code.
